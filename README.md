# Hello

Hi, Iâ€™m @FishyFlower!

I've created this account mainly to contribute to Hackintosh community. I have another account on GitHub for years, but I just want to separate this from my main activities.

## Username and profile pictures

I've considered two classic Mac wallpapers as my profile picture: "Golden Poppy" from Mac OS 9 and "Clown Fish" from Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger. As you might have guess, thus the nickname: fish & flower. FishyFlower.

Fish won. Actually, I really love fishes (in aquarium!) and I wanted to name this account FishMan, but this was already taken. That would be also a nice reference to a well-known person in this communiuty :)

## What I will do? 

I don't have any extensive nor concrete plans, but here are some 'areas of interest':
- [ ] contribute to Dortania guides
- [ ] contribute to Acidanthera project
- [ ] publish documentation for Hacks I own
- [ ] investigate some issues on my own

Stay tunned!

## Contact

I see no reason to contact me at this point, but if you *really* have to, you can always harvest the email from ``git log``.
